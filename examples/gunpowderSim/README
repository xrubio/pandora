This model simulates a military engagement of the gunpowder era (XVII-XIXth centuries), and the excavation of the generated battlefield.


The structure is as follows:

- battle -> Simulation of the engagement
- removeBullets -> Algorithm removing material evidence from the battlefield, modelling the effect of post-depositional processes
- survey -> Simulation of the archaeological fieldworks, with agents collecting musket bullets under different survey conditions
